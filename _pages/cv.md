### Research Analyst

<p>TPG Telecom &nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Sydney, Australia</em>  &nbsp;&nbsp; ‚è≤Ô∏è  <em>Mar 2021 - Dec 2023</em></p>

As a part of the Data and Analytics Centre of Excellence (CoE) team, I transform numerous data into actionable insights.
- [**NPS**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Promoter){:target="_blank"} **topic modelling** - model customers' feedback/comments and derive insights to improve customer service satisfaction
- **Market offer text extraction** - automatically extract and analyse competitors' offers, transforming raw unstructured data into structured data that the market team could use
- **Webchat & Call Centre dialogue analysis** - preliminary study on raw dialogue data between agents and customers
- **Postpay/Prepay/FWA customer insights analysis** - model and analysis customers churn and upgrade
- **Cloud experience** - get involved in cloud services, familiar with data ETL and DevOps on AWS and Databricks

### Front-End Developer Intern

<p>RESORTer &nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Melbourne, Australia </em>  &nbsp;&nbsp; ‚è≤Ô∏è  <em>Nov 2019 - Mar 2020</em></p>

I was responsible for refactoring and developing the Lesson Section in the Web application.

- Refactored the Lesson Section using React + Hooks + Material-UI. Used Grid layout and Card component to render different kinds of lessons and simplified the rendering logic, which was a serious issue when using the Tabs system.
- Managed the global state using Redux and created default lessons for the users based on the form they filled. I also cooperated with my team using Middleware to catch and handle certain actions to ensure the generated lessons are always consistent with the global state, thereby improving the user experience.
- Utilized CSS Module to avoid class names collisions and global style pollution. Used lazy load to dynamically import required components, thereby improving the performance.


## üèóÔ∏è Projects

### üîß [Algorithms in Action](/project/algorithms-in-action)

*March 2020 - October 2020*

> **Try AiA demo here: [https://algorithms-in-action.github.io/](https://algorithms-in-action.github.io/){:target="_blank"}** \
> **Github: [https://github.com/algorithms-in-action/algorithms-in-action.github.io](https://github.com/algorithms-in-action/algorithms-in-action.github.io){:target="_blank"}{:target="_blank"}**

An algorithm visualization Web application provided for the first year Computer Science students.
I was responsible for implementing the pseudocode and algorithm animation.

- Using JavaScript function closures, all the visualization API functions and corresponding variables can be stored in an array and executed later, so it solved using ES6 `Generators` that functions executions cannot be reversed. Thereby, the animation can step backward as well.
- To map the algorithm pseudocode with the actual code, I parsed and added a bookmark in each line of the pseudocode, and inserted the bookmarks at the corresponding position in the actual code, so the pseudocode and animation can be synchronized.
- Implemented a customized hook use interval so that the auto-play function can read fresh states between each render. This hook can also detect the speed changes and reset the setInterval function, thereby adjusting the playback speed is achievable.
- Based on the visualization APIs provided by [Tracer.js](https://github.com/algorithm-visualizer/tracers.js){:target="_blank"}, I implemented some common components and functions and expanded the library as well.

### ‚úèÔ∏è [Distributed Shared Whiteboard](/project/distributed_shared_whiteboard)

*August 2019 - October 2019*

> **Github: [https://github.com/ZhangzihanGit/Distributed-Shared-Whiteboard-Application](https://github.com/ZhangzihanGit/Distributed-Shared-Whiteboard-Application){:target="_blank"}**

A shared whiteboard desktop application that allows multiple users to draw shapes and chat at the same time. I was responsible for developing the client and server GUI.

- The project used Java 8 as the backend language, [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/){:target="_blank"} as the frontend framework, and used a three-tier Client/Server architecture. It separated the client ‚Äì whiteboard server ‚Äì data server.
- Java RMI was used as the communication method between the whiteboard server and data server; the request sends from the client were remotely called in the whiteboard server. To synchronize each client, MQTT was used to provide a subscribe/publish protocol. The whiteboard server was used as an intermediate agent to accept messages from each client and publish the messages to all other subscribers.

### üìê [Guttman Chart Analysis System](/project/guttman_chart_analysis_system)

*Aug 2019 - Nov 2019*

> **Github: [https://github.com/ZhangzihanGit/Guttman-Chart-Analysis-System](https://github.com/ZhangzihanGit/Guttman-Chart-Analysis-System){:target="_blank"}**

A Guttman chart based students assessment analysis system. It can be used to help educators find students‚Äô Zones of Personal Development (ZPD) and adjust future teaching plans.

- The project provided support for the üîó [research](https://education.unimelb.edu.au/research/projects/improving-assessment-with-intelligent-automation){:target="_blank"} in the Assessment Research Centre, Melbourne Graduate School of Education.
- I was responsible for developing the frontend pages and integrating them with the backend developers. The project used Python as the backend programming language, adopted the Client/Server model, and used RESTful API for HTTP communication.
