ðŸ‘‹ My name is **Zihan Zhang** (in Chinese, **å¼ æ¢“æ¶µ**). I'm a third-year [Industry Doctorate Program (IDP)](https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/graduate-research/future-research-students/uts-research-degrees/industry-doctorate-program){:target="_blank"} PhD student at theÂ [University of Technology Sydney (UTS) NLP group](https://utsnlp.github.io/){:target="_blank"}, sponsored by the industry partner [TPG Telecom](https://www.tpgtelecom.com.au/){:target="_blank"}. I am privileged to be supervised byÂ [Prof. Ling Chen](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Ling.Chen){:target="_blank"},Â [Dr Mo Namazi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mo-namazi/?originalSubdomain=au){:target="_blank"}, andÂ [Distinguished Prof. Jie Lu](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Jie.Lu){:target="_blank"}. I am also working closely with [A/Prof. Meng Fang](https://mengf1.github.io/){:target="_blank"} from the University of Liverpool. 
I work at TPG Telecom as a **Research Analyst** in the Data and Analytics Centre of Excellence (CoE) team.
Prior to joining UTS, I obtained my Master degree in Software Engineering from the [University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/){:target="_blank"}.

I have broad research interests centred around **natural language processing (NLP)**. As an IDP PhD student, I am particularly passionate about developing NLP systems that are **practical, robust, efficient, and can be applied to the industry**.
While working at TPG Telecom, I had the chance to apply my skills in solving **real-world business challenges** involving millions of telco data. Specifically, I developed:

- [Clustering-based topic modelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.09874){:target="_blank"} to help the Call Centre team find top topics from millions of customer feedback/comments/survey (NPS) to improve service;
- An efficient [data annotation method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14513){:target="_blank"} for labelling raw dialogue state data, which is essential for building AI-powered chatbots;
- A Market Offer Engine to automatically collect hot offers from the market, which provides an analysis data source for the product team to make pricing strategies;

Recently, my research focus has moved towards **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and exploring how to use them in production to drive business, including efficient and robust **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, **Question Answering (QA)**, and **Dialogue systems**.

While studying Software Engineering, I have gained skills in designing, modelling, and building software applications, especially web applications. Check out previous [ðŸ”¨ software applications](projects) I built with my teammates if you are interested.
